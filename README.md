# KeeleGame

## This game is a 2D top down arcade game, with a keele theme developed in java.

Our player will control a sneaky squirrel who has sunk into the Chancellor's building in order to eat all the food it can get its hands on.

The player will have to avoid a host of enemies which will try and catch the squirel. They include: _the janitor, staff, lecturers and students_. If the player can collect all of the points in the building without being caught then they **WIN!!**.

The player can use the help of the powerups that can be found around the building. These can help the player in desperate times with **special abilities** or provide score _bonuses/multipliers!_
